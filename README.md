Yoricks Stacks is a single page clone of Stack Overflow, a question and answer site for software programming topics.
Yoricks Stacks was built with a Ruby on Rails stack, with a Postgresql database, and a React/Redux frontend.

Features:

- Users can sign up with an email, username, and password
- Question/answer authors can edit their posts
- Users can upvote questions, only once per question/answer
- Site renders changes to page's DOM so only relevant components are updated on refresh
- Uses imports from react-router-dom to facilitate route creation
